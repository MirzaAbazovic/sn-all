By looking at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tmforum-apis/TMF688-Event/master/TMF688-Event-v4.0.0.swagger.json
I get hint that catalog, inventory and rom are modeled as topic which have events.

[Here](https://engage.tmforum.org/communities/community-home/digestviewer/viewthread?MessageKey=dff1a69b-18ab-47eb-97f4-d63803937234&CommunityKey=d543b8ba-9d3a-4121-85ce-5b68e6c31ce5&tab=digestviewer#bmff0c7f17-c36a-487e-9609-d5999cbd6d89) is interesting discussion and at the end ther is note " the TMF688 Event API is a generic API for eventing and streamaing platforms; that means that all Event API resource (Event,Topic,Hub) should be implemented by that streaming platform. (e.g. KAFKA)
The Topic resource is defined as container resource for Event resource .
and can be used to set-up a Topic/event graph for domain specific Event processing.
The Hub resource is defined  for holding subcription for other clients, which can be notified by s.c. CallBack Post operation of the Event API (see.API Notifications chapter) to other clients/Listeners
