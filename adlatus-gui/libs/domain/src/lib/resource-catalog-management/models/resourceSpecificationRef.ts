/**
 * Resources are physical or non-physical components (or some combination of these) within an enterprise's infrastructure or inventory. They are typically consumed or used by services (for example a physical port assigned to a service) or contribute to the realization of a Product (for example, a SIM card). They can be drawn from the Application, Computing and Network domains, and include, for example, Network Elements, software, IT systems, content and information, and technology components. A ResourceSpecification is an abstract base class for representing a generic means for implementing a particular type of Resource. In essence, a ResourceSpecification defines the common attributes and relationships of a set of related Resources, while Resource defines a specific instance that is based on a particular ResourceSpecification.
